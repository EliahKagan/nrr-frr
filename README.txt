nrr.cmd and frr.cmd are Windows utilities.

To install them, copy nrr.cmd and frr.cmd to a directory in your %PATH%
environment variable.

Running "nrr RepoName" (without the quotes) makes a remote repo RepoName.git.

Running "frr RepoName" (without the quotes) gives the URL of the repo of that
name, or suggests similar repo names if there is no repo by that name.
